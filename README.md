# Solidity verifier of groth16 proofs using BLS12_381

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a Solidity based verifier of groth16 proofs that uses the BLS12_381 curve.

The miller_loop implementation is based on https://github.com/ewynx/noir_bls12_381_pairing.

## Test

```shell
npm i
npx hardhat test
```
